To build/package app:
-   In ../asyncCompanion/RSCompanionAsync/Model/app_defs.py, update version_number and set release bool to True.
-   In ../asyncCompanion/For_setup/comp_app_setup.py,   (Use either forward-slash '/' or double back-slash '\\' in .py files)
    -   update root_dir.                                        Ex. C:/RSDev
-   In ../asyncCompanion/For_setup/comp_app_inno.iss,   (Use back-slash '\' in .iss files)
    -   make sure BuildDir points to your Builds directory.     Ex. C:\RSDev\Builds\
    -   make sure AppVMaj and AppVMin are set to match app version.
-   In ../asyncCompanion/For_setup/setup.bat,           (Use back-slash '\' or double back-slash '\\' in .bat files)
    -   make sure APPDIR points to your app dir's parent dir.   Ex. C:\RSDev\asyncCompanion would be C:\RSDev\
    -   make sure PYTHONDIR points to your python directory.    Ex. ..\Python\Python37\
-   run setup.bat in terminal.
-   compile comp_app_inno.iss using Inno Setup Compiler.

-   Make sure your ..\Python\Python37\Lib\site-packages\mpl_toolkits\ has an __init__.py file in it.
