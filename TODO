# TODO: Pressing matters.
    - Implement camera handler in app_controller.py (Turning cameras on or off).
    - Finish fine tuning MDI subwindows.
        - Make subwindows rearrange/resize/move on main window resize.
        - Redesign subwindow layouts for drt and vog to be the same.
            - Make subwindows smaller and same size as each other.
            - Make subwindow config pop up activator be a menu bar item instead of a QPushButton.
    - Implement CAM.
        - Consider passing selected fps to writer instead of current fps.
        - Implement fps selection and resolution selection
        - View
            - Implement config pop up.
        - Cameras are not in sync over time. (Only on Phillip's machine...sad)
        - c920 not always getting max advertised fps. (Joel's machine has no problems...isn't he cool)
    - Implement playback of experiment data.
        - Scanning through data example: DRT_7,_8,_9 clicks threshold x, scan through all by timestamp.
    - Alter save format to be folder per experiment instead of .rs files.

# TODO: At some point
    - Consider making properties out of our getter/setter methods.
        - https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php
    - Check all files for proper and complete logging usage.
    - Figure out how to get app to work with other character languages.
        - Chinese
        - Japanese
        - Russian
    - Add more languages.
    - Finish adding/translating languages for current string.py files.
    - Look over https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html and make edits to imports.

Languages:
    - Mandarin (Chinese simplified/formal)
    - Australian
    - European languages
    - 10 most spoken languages would be nice.
