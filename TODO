    - ERROR ID: 10-t

TODO: Pressing matters.
    - Figure out xbee api mode
        https://serdmanczyk.github.io/XBeeAPI-PythonArduino-Tutorial/
    - in Info box:
        - Add current time
        - Add block start time
        - Ensure Block number is there
        - Ensure exp start time is there
    - Response times of -1 (a miss) should not be plotted at all or the color of their marker should be Red.
        Right now they appear to be an extremely fast reaction time in the plot


TODO: At some point
    - Figure out how to catch SIGINT and close cameras gracefully.
    - Consider creating a base class(es) for Horizontally Graphable Devices (?) such as drt and vog.
    - Implement audio recording. (SimpleAudio, PyAudio, etc.)
        - Try to figure out which camera each mic belongs to and make that an mp4.
        - If mic is not attached to camera then save as audio file.
        - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14140495/how-to-capture-a-video-and-audio-in-python-from-a-camera-or-webcam
    - Consider making properties out of our getter/setter methods.
        - https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php
    - Check all modules for proper and complete logging usage.
    - Implement playback of experiment data.
        - Scanning through data example: DRT_7,_8,_9 clicks threshold x, scan through all by timestamp.
        - Reimplement saving as .rs files.
    - Figure out how to get app to work with non-ascii character languages. Issue seems to be with matplotlib.
        - Chinese
        - Japanese
        - Russian
    - Add more languages.
        - Top 10 most spoken languages would be nice.
    - Finish adding/translating languages for current string.py files.
    - Look over https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html and make edits to imports.
    - Look at info_box.py empty QLabel items and consider a spacer item instead.
    - extract view from controller
    - Look up python support for xb radio?

TODO: Test this thing like crazy!
    - Look for if video is smooth on saved files even if it's not in the preview in the app.
    - Proper app usage tests.
    - Improper app usage tests.
    - Check .csv output files for any issues with notes, flags, events, device data, number of comma separators.


TODO: Bug fixes.
    - When multiple devices are plugged in and an exp and block are running:
        - dev window does not disappear on device unplug
        - Replugging device causes new window to appear (multiple windows for same device)
        - Issue with control loss if new device is plugged in:
            Related to a window not being removed when a device is unplugged during an experiment.
            If the ghost window stays around and another device is plugged in, the ghost window appears to block the
            functionality of the block start button. I plugged in a drt, started a block, removed the DRT during a
            block (window stays), ended the experiment, plugged in a VOG, started an experiment, now the block start
            button does nothing and the app wont close
    Heisenbugs:
    -   Error saving what seems to be last data line from device when ending experiment.
    -   Sometimes when unplugging cameras during initialization, the device window fails to disappear.
    -   Exception ignored in: <finalize object at 0x1a8c3f03ee0; dead>  # Fixed?
