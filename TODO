# TODO: Pressing matters.
    - App not closing
    - Look through all device MVC and update app closure processes to use async.
    - Implement camera handler in app_controller.py
    - Finish fine tuning MDI subwindows.
        - Make subwindows rearrange/resize/move on main window resize.
        - Make subwindows not able to move outside the main window size.
            - Do we still want to do this now that we have scroll bars?
        - Redesign subwindow layouts for drt and vog to be the same. Remove config into pop up window, compact drt graphs into same graph.
    - Implement CAM.
        - Model.
            - Fix app closure handling, sometimes hangs on cleanup() call.
            - Look into how saving video is handled when ending experiments vs. when closing app during experiment.
        - Controller.
            - Need to implement handlers.
        - Finish view.
            - Check window sizing.
            - Fix image resizing based on subwindow size.
    - Implement playback of experiment data.
        - Scanning through data example: DRT_7,_8,_9 clicks threshold x, scan through all by timestamp.
    - Alter save format to be folders instead of .rs files.

# TODO: At some point
    - Check all files for proper and complete self._logger usage.
    - Figure out how to get app to work with other character languages.
        - Chinese
        - Japanese
        - Russian
    - Add more languages.
    - Finish adding/translating languages for current string.py files.
    - Look over https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html and make edits to imports.
Languages:
    - Mandarin (Chinese simplified/formal)
    - Australian
    - European languages
    - 10 most spoken languages would be nice.
